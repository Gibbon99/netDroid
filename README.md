# netDroid
Paradroid - networked.

This project is an attempt to create a networked version of Paradroid - see https://github.com/Gibbon99/ParaPlusPlus for a standalone single player version.

This project is also about learning networking and client/server interaction.

It features a console based Linux server, and a cross platform client - it currently supports three languages, and will load all it's data files from the server when connecting.
